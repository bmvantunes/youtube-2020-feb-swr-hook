In order to run this application you need to `npm install`.

# Run the app
```sh
npm run dev
```

# Run mock-server
```sh
npm run mock-server
```

PS - You'll need one command line instance to `npm run dev` and one for `npm run mock-server`. If you prefer, to have only one instance you can play with [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently)
